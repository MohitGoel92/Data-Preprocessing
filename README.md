# Data Preprocessing

In any Machine Learning process, data preprocessing is a crucial step in which the data gets cleaned, Encoded and at times reduced to bring it to a state where the machine can easily process it. In other words, the features of the data can now be easily interpreted by the algorithm. If we do not perform the data preprocessing step, the machine learning model may not work properly. There are four main steps to data preprocessing, they include: taking care of missing data, encoding categorical data, splitting the dataset into the training set and test set, and feature scaling.
